It happened multiple times when people asked about my profession, I answered theoretical physics, then the room is filled with awkward silence. The problem seems to be a lack of questions that interest both parties, namely the professionals and the hobbyists. So I decide to write a small manual on some interesting physical theories that are not necessarily correct or verifiable, but nevertheless make fun topics among the laymen population.

## Do we live inside a blackhole?

No. But we may live _outside the blackhole_.

This conjecture arise from the observation that the radius of the cosmic horizon equals the Schwarzschild radius if the total mass of visible universe forms a blackhole.

$$ M=\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \times \frac{3 H^2}{8\pi G} = \frac{H^2 R^3}{2 G} = \frac{R}{2 G} \Rightarrow R=2GM $$

The conjecture is not true because the singularity should have killed us. Alas, it did not. In fact, our universe has been behaving more like a whitehole, in the sense that it sprung from a singularity and coughed out all sorts of weird stuff. However, the resemblance of cosmic horizon to blackhole horizons does bear some intersting physical insights.
