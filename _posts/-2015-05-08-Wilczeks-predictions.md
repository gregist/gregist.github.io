Frank Wilczek recently published a paper named "[Physics in 100 years][1]". He made some very insightful/delightful predictions.

Here I summarize his main points:

Unifications
---

1. Forces

    * Verification of the CORE Theory, $$SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) \times SO(3,1)$$.

2. Forces and Substance

    * Verification and development of SUSY.

3. Space time and Matter

    * GUT + gravity, i.e. the Holy Grail.

4. Evolution and Origin

    * *The fundamental laws will no longer admit arbitrary initial conditions, and will not take the form of evolution equations.*

5. Action and Information

    * Force -> Energy -> Action -> ?
    * Both are dimensionless. Both are important quantities. There must be something deep between the two.

6. Quantum and Symmetry

    * Both admits non-commutativity. Are they two faces of one coin?

7. Mind and Matter

    * I will understand *how I work*.

Vistas
---

1. Bootstrap engineering.

2. Induced synesthesia.

3. Quantum computing.

4. Expanded identity.

5. Emerging humility.
