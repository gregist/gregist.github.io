Thank you Jekyll, Pixyll and GitHub. \$$\text{I}\;<3\;\text{GitHub}$$

I study Physics, I use Linux and I adore Poetry. So I will mainly blog about these.

And in case you don't already know, $$AdS==CFT$$ is the most beautiful equation ever.

Here is a test of inline equations, $$23+2=25$$, or display like this,

\$$\langle e^{\int d^d x J(x) \mathcal{O}(x)}\rangle_{QFT}=e^{-S_{bulk}[\phi(x,z)|_{z=0}\rightarrow J(x)]}$$

Good.

The following is a math block:

$$ 5 + 5 $$

But next comes a paragraph with an inline math statement:

\$$ 5 + 5 $$
