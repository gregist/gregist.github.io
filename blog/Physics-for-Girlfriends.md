It happened multiple times when people asked about my profession, I answered theoretical physics, then the room is filled with awkward silence. The problem seems to be a lack of questions that interest both parties. So I decide to write a small manual on some interesting theories that are not necessarily correct or verifiable, but nevertheless make fun topics among the laymen population.

## Do we live in a blackhole?

No. But we may live _outside the blackhole_.

This conjecture arise from the observation that the radius of the cosmic horizon equals the Schwarzschild radius if the total mass of visible universe forms a blackhole.

The conjecture is not true because the singularity should have killed us, alas, it did not. In fact, our universe behave more like a whitehole instead of a black one, in the sense that it sprung from a singularity and produced all sorts of weird stuff. However, the resemblance of cosmic horizon to blackhole horizons
