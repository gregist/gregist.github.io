* What is spacetime?  

> Spacetime is a mathematical construct that we use to describe our beloved Universe. Empirically, one finds that spacetime can be described mathematically by the structure of a 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold without boundary. That is why we normally have 3 position coordinates and one time coordinate, no matter how we set up the coordinate system. In sub-atom scales things turn out to be a little more complicated. We may need to work in different types of manifolds and add some more coordinates. It is not really a big deal though.

<!-- It is intuitive to choose the 'space' and 'time' coordinates not only in the sense that we can perceive them in our daily life, but also because of a deep correspondence between translational symmetries and conservation laws. -->
