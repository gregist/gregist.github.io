Here I list some non-technical papers that I have found very interesting to read.

* [[hep-ph/0201222] Four Big Questions with Pretty Good Answers](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0201222)  

By Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek. The four questions are:  
    1. What is the Origin of Mass?
    2. Why is Gravity Feeble?
    3. Are the Laws of Physics Unique?
    4. What happened if you keep squeezing?
